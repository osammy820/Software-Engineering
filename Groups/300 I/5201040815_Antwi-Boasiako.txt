Question 1.

	Ans: A software process product interaction model is a normalized way to deal with programming improvement that aides
	 	the exercises of the product improvement group. It characterizes a bunch of exercises, achievements,
		what's more, expectations that should be finished all through the product improvement lifecycle.
Question 2.  
	Ans: Waterfall and Agile are two software process models that have massive contrasts in their methodology
	 	to programming advancement. Cascade is a straight, successive way to deal with programming improvement, where each stage
	 	of the advancement interaction is finished prior to continuing on toward the following stage. The critical stages in the Cascade model are
		prerequisites gathering, plan, execution, testing, and support. Conversely, Nimble is an iterative and gradual
	 	way to deal with programming advancement that stresses cooperation, adaptability, and consumer loyalty. Spry advancement is
		coordinated into little, reasonable emphasess called runs, with an emphasis on conveying working programming rapidly and constantly
	 	further developing the item founded on criticism. The vital contrasts between the two models are their way to deal with prerequisites, the request
		of the improvement cycle, their degree of adaptability and their speed.
			The Cascade model gives an unbending and organized process which might bring about additional anticipated results however might be unyielding and
		slow to respond to change. Spry model gives an adaptable and iterative methodology that can answer rapidly to change yet may result
		 in less unsurprising results because of its fast speed and spotlight on evolving necessities.
Question 3.
	Ans: Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a product improvement process model that depends on the iterative and steady methodology of Light-footed,
		 however, with a more prominent accentuation on documentation, engineering, and formal venture the executives. RUP partitions the product advancement process into
	 	four stages: Initiation, Elaboration, Development, and Change. In the Beginning stage, the undertaking degree and prerequisites are characterized.
		 In the Elaboration stage, the product engineering is planned, and the framework necessities are broke down. In the Development stage,
		the product is created, tried, and incorporated. In the Change stage, the product is conveyed, and the framework is tried and assessed.
		 The vital advantages of RUP remember its accentuation for documentation, formal undertaking the executives, and quality confirmation.
		Be that as it may, a portion of the disadvantages incorporate its intricacy, high above, and potential for postponed project conveyance because of its exhaustive cycle.
