1.Software Processes is a coherent set of activities for specifying, 
designing, implementing and testing software systems. A software process
 model is an abstract representation of a process that presents a description
  of a process from some particular perspective. There are many different 
  software processes but all involve:
  1.specification
  2.Design and implementation 
  3.Validation
  4.Evolution
It is important because, The models provide you with the ways and means to achieve your
 goal when working on a project and give you clear directions, methods on how to 
 achieve your target, and solutions when trying to fix

  The differences between Waterfall and agile model are;
        *Waterfall is a Linear Sequential Life Cycle Model, whereas Agile is a continuous iteration of development
            and testing in the software development process.

        *In Agile vs Waterfall difference, the Agile methodology is known for its flexibility,
            whereas Waterfall is a structured software development methodology.

        *Comparing the Waterfall methodology vs Agile, which follows an incremental approach, 
        whereas the Waterfall is a sequential design process.

        *Agile performs esting concurrently with software development, whereas in Waterfall methodology, 
        testing comes after the “Build” phase.

        *Agile allows changes in project development requirements, whereas Waterfall has no scope of 
        changing the requirements once the project development starts.
    
   Benefits of water fall model
        *It is focused client process. So, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved
        during every stage.

        *Agile teams are extremely motivated and self-organized so it likely to provide a better
        result from the development projects.

        *Agile software development method assures that quality of the development is maintained

    Drawbacks of Waterfall model
        *It is not an ideal model for a large size project
        *If the requirement is not clear at the beginning, it is a less effective method.
        *Very difficult to move back to makes changes in the previous phases.

 Rational Unified Process(RUP);
    Is a software development process for object-oriented models.
    It is also known as the Unified Process Model. It is created by Rational corporation and is 
    designed and documented using UML (Unified Modeling Language). This process is included in IBM
    Rational Method Composer (RMC) product. IBM (International Business Machine Corporation) allows
    us to customize, design, and personalize the unified process. RUP is proposed by Ivar Jacobson,
    Grady Bootch, and James Rambaugh. Some characteristics of RUP include use-case driven, Iterative 
    (repetition of the process), and Incremental (increase in value) by nature, delivered online using 
    web technology, can be customized or tailored in modular and electronic form, etc. RUP reduces unexpected 
    development costs and prevents wastage of resources. 


  Software Development Lifecycle" is a general term for almost any software development process that is typically broken up
  into sequential phases with phase gates to approve transitions between phases. The phases are typically something like Requirements,
  Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Release, etc. This is what many people call a "Waterfall" process but that term is very widely misused.

 The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative process where instead of attempting to deliver
 the entire system in one end-to-end lifecycle set of phases (like Waterfall), the system is delivered in iterations 
 where the iterations are a successive series of releases each with an increasing level of completeness. Within each iteration there is a mini-lifecycle 
 model consisting of (1) inception, (2) elaboration, (3) construction, and (4) transition; however, in practice, the phases may bleed into each other and may
 not have rigid phase transitions like a pure Waterfall model. The original RUP process was designed heavily around the Rational toolset which can be very expensive; 
 however, variations such
 as the Enterprise Unified Process (EUP) have evolved that are toolset agnostic.

 Stages in Rationl Unified Process are;
   * Inception 
   * Elaboration 
   * Construction 
   * Transition 
   * Production 

Benefits of Rational Unified process
    *It provides good documentation, it completes the process in itself.
    *It provides risk-management support.
    *It reuses the components, and hence total time duration is less.

Drawbacks Of Rational Unified process
   *Team of expert professional is required, as the process is complex.
   *Complex and not properly organized process.
   *More dependency on risk management.
