QUE1: Software process model is an abstract representation of a process which includes the division of software development work into phases .
It serves as a guide for project managers by providing a graphical interface.

QUE2: Waterfall model treats each software development life cycle as distinct, isolated event whereas Agile model advocates iterative development 
cycles in which multiples phases can run in parallel or at the same time.
                 BENEFITS
 -Waterfall model helps to transfer information very well since one phase need to be completed before moving to another stage.
 -Agile model encourages testing and validating in the software development life cycle and this reduces risk occurances.
               DRAWBACKS
*Waterfall model makes future changes to the software development very difficult.
*Agile model is hard to predict.

QUE3: Rational Unified Proces = Is a modern generic process model that is organized into phases. Although it's organized into phases but separates 
activities such as requirement, analysis, design etc. from the phase.
                  KEY PHASES OF RATIONAL UNIFIED PROCESS (RUP)
1. Inception
2. Elaboration
3. Construction
4. Transition
                     ACTIVITIIES INVOLVED IN RATIONAL UNIFIED PROCESS
a. requirement
b. analysis
c. design
d. implementation
                    BENEFITS OF RUP
- It emphasises on the need to accurate documentation or suggest good practices.
                    DRAWBACKS
- It is a complex moedl to implement as it has multiple stages of the workflow.
