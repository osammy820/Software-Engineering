Q1  Software process model is a mechanism that detailed the software development process , it also helps provide a visual representation of the development process for both the team and their customers to review 
Why it important in software development 
•	It outlines a distinct set of activities ,actions , tasks and deliverables required to engineer a high quality software 
•	It provides a stability control and organization to a process that if not managed will get out of hand easily 
They’re adjustable to meet the needs of the software engineer and manages for a specific project 
Q2
Similarities 
All involves;
•	Requirement gathering 
•	Analysis and design 
•	Development and Implementation 
•	Testing and Evaluation 
Differences
Waterfall	Agile 
Doesn't adapt to change	Adapts to change
Follows a fixed plan with a linear process	Iterative and incremental approach

Key difference 
Waterfall breaks down software developments into isolated phases that  flow into each others while agile advocates iterative development cycle
Q3 
In RUP , the processes are (that is the analysis,Design,Coding and testing) are done iteratively and concurrently while Software process model such as waterfall model is done sequentially 
RUP phases are all multi-disciplinary while other software process models are single discipline


Key phases	Activity 
Inception 	Acquisition of stakeholders agreement on the project 
Elaboration 		Requirement and architectural are evaluated and analyzed
Construction 	This phase the application is built and tested 
Transition 	Final phase where testing conducted 

Benefits 
•	Improves resource management 
•	Cost-effectiveness 
•	Improves cooperation between participants 
Drawbacks
•	Sometimes influences financial plans
•	It’s time consuming
