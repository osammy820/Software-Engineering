ANSWERS
1. A software process model is an abstraction of the software development process.
The models specify the stages and order of a process.
So, think of this as a representation of the order of activities of the process and
the sequence in which they are performed.

A software model is a very useful tool in software development.
Through the software model, the complexity of the entire software
can be analyzed and also the strategy behind
the development of the software can be estimated

2. Agile is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process
whereas Waterfall is a Linear Sequential Life Cycle Model.
the Agile methodology is known for its flexibility,
whereas Waterfall is a structured software development methodology.
Agile, which follows an incremental approach,
whereas the Waterfall is a sequential design process.
Agile performs testing concurrently with software development,
whereas in Waterfall methodology, testing comes after the “Build” phase.
Agile allows changes in project development requirements,
whereas Waterfall has no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts.

Benefits of Agile Software Process model
1. More adaptability
2. Continuous improvement
3. Better teamwork
4. Increases motivation
5. Relevant metrics for data-driven decisions

Drawbacks of Agile Software Process model
1. Less predictability.
2. More time and commitment.
3. Greater demands on developers and clients.
4. Lack of necessary documentation.
5. Project easily falls off track.

Benefits of waterfall Software Process model
1. Uses A Clear Structure
2. Progression Is Intuitive
3. Determine The End Goal Early
4. Fewer Chances Of Losing Details
5. Transfer Of Knowledge In Superior Ways

Drawbacks of waterfall Software Process model
1. The waterfall model doesn’t support making changes.
2. It can invalidate the work you’ve previously accomplished.
3. This method excludes end-users and clients.
4. It delays testing until after the completion of the project.
5. The waterfall model can promote longer delivery times.


3. The Rational Unified Proces Methodology (RUP) is an agile software development method,
in which the life cycle of a project, or the development of software, is divided into four phases.
Various activities take place during these phases: modelling, analysis and design, implementation, testing and application.
The Rational Unified Process is a refinement of the Unified Process that was created by Rational Software (now owned by IBM).
It uses a series of software tools along with a process framework to define how to carry out the activities needed to
run a software project, yet still provides a framework for tailoring to meet an organization's (or team's) needs.
